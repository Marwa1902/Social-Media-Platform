# Social Media Platform
 Code of Social Media Analystics ; only backened and database
 In today’s digital age, social media platforms are filled with unstructured data. Between user interaction, posts, comments, and multimedia content. During this time, social media analysis firms started emerging from different places, trying to make use of this data to empower businesses, enhance marketing, understand user behaviour, and observe sentiments across diverse social media channels.

 ## Objectives
To design and implement a scalable NoSQL database system for one of the leading social media analytics firms “Ajax. This system aims to facilitate the processing and analysis of vast amounts of social media data in real-time.
Ajax recognizes the critical importance of harnessing social media data to deliver valuable insight to its clients. As such, the core focus of this project revolves around meeting Ajax’s specific requirements for a robust analytics platform.

## Proposed Project
To address Ajax's needs and overcome the challenges in social media data processing, we propose the implementation of a NoSQL database system tailored for their analytics platform on MongoDB.
NoSQL Database Model Selection: MongoDB is chosen as the NoSQL database platform due to its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data efficiently. Its document-oriented data model aligns well with the varied and dynamic nature of social media data.
Database Schema Design: MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for flexible and dynamic schema design. The schema can be designed to accommodate diverse types of social media data such as text, images, videos, user profiles, comments, likes, shares, etc.
